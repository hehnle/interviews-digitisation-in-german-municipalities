# Expert Interviews with German Municipalities in order to Evaluate the Challenge of Digitising Business Processes with Varying Implementations
The folder "english" contains the translated interview notes.

There are some German domain specific words that are hard to translate.
In the following, there is a list of domain specific terms and how they were translated:

* Fachanwendung: This is a special term used by German agencies to describe information systems (mostly process-aware) that are explictly built for the public sector. We translated this term to "specialised information system" as there is no literal translation.
* Kasse: This term literally translates to "checkout counter". In this context, we translated it to "finance department".
* Antragsstrecke: This a special term in the public sector describing which denotes applying for governmental services and the business process of checking the application. As this is a business process , we used the term "business process".
* Landkreis: While there are different possible translation, we decided to use "county".
* To ensure authenticity, different municipalities apply various forms of physical proofs to the parking permit (i.e. to stamp or to seal the parking permit).
* We use the term "invoice" for the document which ask the applicant to pay for the parking permit, although German agencies/authorities use a different term compared to the private sector.
